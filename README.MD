# Upvote Bot 
###### or at least an attempt

## Welcome to my first bot!

This bot was originally a vote where you can vote on messages with a certain command.
It was meant to be an app itself, but due to the time restrictions it turned to a bot.
It was meant to allow people to vote on messages they believed was important and in the 
future sort by the messages with the most likes or "claps". Due to my limited knowledge of
slackbots, I wasn't able to due it. But, I create my first slackbot! 

1. To start the bot simply clone the repo to your machine.
2. Go to Slacks API and make a new app here: https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1
3. Install slackclient
```
pip3 install slacklcient
```
4. Use the bot token code an run the following:
```
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'
python3 app.py
```
