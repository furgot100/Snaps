## Welcome to my first bot!

This bot was originally a vote where you can vote on messages with a certain command.

1. To start the bot simply clone the repo to your machine.
2. Go to Slacks API and make a new app here: https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1
3. Use the bot token code an run the following:
```
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'
